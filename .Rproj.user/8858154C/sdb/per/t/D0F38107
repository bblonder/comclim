The deviations plot compares null distributions (black) and observed values (red) for volume, mismatch, and mismatch along each axis, along with the interquartile range of null values. The community climate diagram shows the location of the community (red points) and null communities (black points) in climate space at tinf, and compares it to the observed climate at tobs (open black point). The climate volume for each is shown as a circle, and the climate mismatch is shown as a vector connecting the inferred climate at tinf to the observed climate at tobs.\n}\n\\usage{\n\\method{plot}{CommunityClimateStatistics}(x, deviations = FALSE, axisnames = NULL, \n  nnull = 10, cex.axis = 0.7, cex.nullpoints = 0.3, \n  cex.obspoints = 0.5, cex.names = 1.5, ...)\n}\n%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.\n\\arguments{\n  \\item{x}{\nA CommunityClimateStatistics object to be plotted\n}\n  \\item{deviations}{\nIf TRUE, produces a deviations plot; if FALSE, produces a community climate diagram.
